INSTALLING FROM GIT/BASEFILES
=============================
#. **Use git to grab the files from github**, using one of the workflow ideas
   outline by `gitwash<http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/stable/devel/guidelines/gitwash/index.html>`_, but obviously replacing nipy with math-atlas.

#. **Extract Makefile that will build the ATLAS source tree**:
Decide where you wish to create the ATLAS source tree.  This directory should
not presently exist, since the \texttt{Makefile} is going to create it for you.
Create the source tree with the command::
   
   make srcdir=<your chosen directory>

if *srcdir* is not given the *Makefile* creates a directory *TEST* in the 
*math-atlas* directory (i.e. *srcdir* defaults to *./TEST*).

#. **Create ATLAS source tree**:
   cd to your *srcdir* and issue *make* to build the ATLAS tree.
   After the tree is built, *./atltar.sh* will build the standard
   tarfile from the ATLAS source tree generated by *make*.

# **Extract**: Read all about 
`extract<http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~whaley/extract/Extract.html>` 
in order to understand why I use basefiles, and what extract
is doing when creating your source tree.
